# APFT Calculator Written in Dart/Flutter

# THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS

This APFT Calculator should be able to run on Android, iOS, Web, Mac OS, and soon, Linux and Windows.

While SQLite would have been a perfect fit for this application, it is currently not supported for Flutter Web applications. This is the reasoning for currently using the hardcoded values. Once Flutter Web can use SQLite, it will be used instead.

This template should also allow for easy translation to the new upcoming ACFT.
